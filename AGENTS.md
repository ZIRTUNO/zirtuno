## 1. The Project

Zirtuno is a Brazilian digital studio that builds complete digital ecosystems:
software, AI, automation, data, branding, and marketing connected into one
structure.

The website must be both:

- an award-level, cinematic expression of the brand; and
- a serious conversion-focused business site.

The target balance is **70% strategic clarity · 30% poetic atmosphere**.
A visitor must understand what Zirtuno sells before reaching the poetic peak.

PT-BR is primary and EN is secondary. Both ship as authored copy, not literal
automatic translations. Shipped copy lives only in
`lib/i18n/messages/pt.json` and `lib/i18n/messages/en.json`.

## 2. Brand Essence

Zirtuno joins the quiet transforming force of Zéfiro with the direction and
courage of Ventura. The current Origin story is grounded in the real company:
two brothers, three founding pillars, and the drive to build what does not yet
exist. Mythology is a dim grace note, not the chapter’s main claim.

The brand is quiet but powerful: transformation without noise, structure given
to what was dispersed.

**Discreto. Preciso. Transformador. Claro. Estratégico. Comercialmente forte.**

## 3. Current Redevelopment State

The site is in R5, “One Continuous Liquid.”

- **R5-A is complete:** one persistent homepage canvas, one measurement loop,
  the conductor, continuous 48-droplet identity, form-slot arbitration, scene
  handoffs, footer inside the page stage, and one-canvas verification.
- **R5-B is complete:** velocity state, fixed-step fluid physics, repulsion,
  cohesion, curl drift, page-wide cursor forces, pinch-off satellites, and the
  `bind` compatibility contract. `?fphys=0` is the rollback/A-B path.
- **R5-C is complete:** the framebuffer post chain (selective bloom, blue-noise
  dither, luminance-gated grain), identity-gated in-shader grade (exposure,
  key boost, internal absorption, `iBallZ` depth bands), the `full-nofx`
  watchdog rung, and the ~30 Hz idle energy governor. `?fgrade=0` is the exact
  optics bypass; `?fgov=0` disables the governor; `verify-postfx.mjs` and the
  `verify-rest-exact.mjs` byte gate protect it.
- **R5-D is complete:** the cinematic cut. Seven scene modules
  (site · método · work · origin · studio · contact · footer) leave no
  liquid-dead band: the work CURRENT (Método's satellites as a slow gyre
  behind the grid + the hovered-card meniscus), the studio ECHO orbits, the
  contact GATHER, and the footer RELEASE (the mark's lowest droplet exits
  past the page bottom). Scenes author the light score; it drives the R5-C
  in-liquid grade AND `CinematicVeils` (exposure veil, vignette, flash).
  Exactly two act-boundary fades (Método→Work, Origin→Studio; peak ≤ 0.4,
  contrast-audited) and exactly ONE Origin flash — latched in the conductor
  per page load, ≤400 ms by construction, absent under reduced motion.
  `Reveal variant="blur"` carries the Soul/Invitation copy. `?fcine=0` is
  the cinematic escape hatch; `verify-cinematics.mjs` is the machine gate.
- **R5-E closes:** device, battery, context-loss, accessibility, locale,
  content-truth, conversion, and final regression hardening.

## 4. Non-Negotiable Rules

1. **One liquid means one persistent homepage canvas.** The same canonical 48
   droplets travel from Hero to Footer. Do not add per-chapter canvases,
   remount the liquid between sections, or simulate continuity with a swap.
   Deterministic hero QA renderers and separate non-homepage surfaces are the
   only narrow exceptions.
2. **The liquid carries the business argument.** The mark pours and fractures
   in Problem, seeks and reconnects in Ecosystem, then blooms through the
   service forms. Work, Studio, Contact, and Footer must not become liquid-free
   dead zones in the final cut.
3. **Exact form endpoints are sacred.** The owner-traced mark and seven SVGs
   are the canonical forms. Rest renders through their SDFs using the locked
   glass model. `forms:rest` must remain byte-exact whenever shader, SDF,
   renderer, post, or form code changes.
4. **Morphs are one in-field liquid bridge, never a crossfade.** Preserve the
   48-droplet §3.3 bridge, min-travel correspondence, regional stagger,
   radius-leading motion, exact form endpoints, and shared iso-surface. See
   `metaball-morph-spec.md`.
5. **Preserve the conductor contracts.** Scenes emit targets; the conductor
   owns damping, presence, target blending, integration, packing, and score.
   Scenes never allocate per droplet per frame and write every output field.
   A new scene may receive the two form slots only after the current holder’s
   total form weight is below `EPS_FORM`. Forms never crossfade between scenes.
6. **Preserve the bind contract.** `bind=1` reproduces the signed-off legacy
   low-pass exactly for resting footprints and melts. `bind=0` allows full
   physics for pours, scatters, currents, and echoes. Do not “improve” exact
   choreography by bypassing bind.
7. **Typography is a four-role system.** Hero headline and every section
   `h2` use Bricolage Grotesque (`font-grotesk`). Body, UI, navigation,
   subheads, leads, forms, and mid-titles use Geist (`font-sans`). Instrument
   Serif italic is poetry-only. JetBrains Mono carries labels, numbers,
   counters, and CTAs. Use the `--text-*` tiers in `globals.css`; do not
   hardcode type sizes.
8. **Color discipline is cyan on black.** No purple, green, rainbow
   iridescence, or off-brand gradients. Use only the tokens in §6. Bloom,
   exposure, depth, and the one cyan-white flash may change light—not the brand
   hue.
9. **Never invent proof.** Portfolio outcomes are verified metrics, honest
   narratives, or explicitly labeled “Arquitetura selecionada / Selected
   architecture.” Prototype data is local scaffolding, not launch proof.
10. **The contact submit stays obvious.** The real labeled
    “Solicitar análise inicial / Request initial analysis” button is canonical.
    The metaball exhale is additive feedback, never the only submit control.
11. **CTA hierarchy and intent are load-bearing.** Keep the placement map in
    `build-spec.md §7.2`. Every contact CTA carries its entry-intent tag.
    Homepage CTAs use Lenis smooth-scroll plus `history.replaceState`; cross-page
    CTAs keep routed navigation.
12. **Conversion copy stays server-rendered.** Problem, Ecosystem, Services,
    Method, Work, Origin, Studio, and Contact meaning must remain in semantic
    RSC/HTML. WebGL is enhancement, never the only carrier of information.
13. **Accessibility is part of the feature.** Keyboard navigation, visible
    focus, semantic controls, AA contrast, error announcements, static
    fallbacks, and complete reduced-motion reading paths are required. The
    Origin flash occurs once, lasts at most 400 ms, stays within WCAG flash
    limits, and is absent under reduced motion.
14. **The liquid never freezes as a performance fallback.** The watchdog lowers
    effects, cadence, or resolution. Full → full-nofx → lite → half is the
    shipped ladder, and the idle governor floors at ~30 Hz — never zero.
    “None” is an initial no-WebGL/probe fallback, not a watchdog freeze.
15. **Do not reintroduce retired architecture.** No Three.js, R3F, Drei,
    raymarch hero, mesh metaballs, `can-run-glass`, GPU-name blocklist,
    `?glass=` API, or manually synchronized second visual engine.
16. **Signature surfaces are bespoke.** No marketplace/default-shadcn visual in
    Hero, Problem, Ecosystem, Services liquid, Método liquid, Origin, Contact
    liquid, or the cinematic layer. Utility primitives may be used only with
    explicit approval and complete Zirtuno restyling.

## 5. Experience Architecture

The nine chapters retain their business-first order but are now composed as
five acts:

| Act | Chapters | Required liquid transition |
|---|---|---|
| I — Signal | Entry veil → Hero | assembly |
| II — Argument | Problem → Ecosystem → Services | pour → fracture → seek → bloom |
| III — Practice | Método → Work | rehearse → current |
| IV — Soul | Origin → Studio | fuse + flash |
| V — Invitation | Contact → Footer | gather → release |

The liquid and light motivate transitions. Repeated chapter border lines do
not. The Footer belongs inside `PageStage` on homepage routes so the release
can reach the true bottom.

Chapter order:

```text
01 Hero
02 The Problem
03 The Ecosystem
04 The Services
05 Método Zirtuno
06 Selected Work
07 The Origin
08 The Studio
09 Contact
Footer coda
```

## 6. Locked Design and Technology

### Palette

```css
--color-ink:#000000;
--color-surface:#0A0A0C;
--color-cyan:#00E3FE;
--color-cyan-glow:#4DECFF;
--color-cyan-deep:#00B6CC;
--color-paper:#F2F0EB;
--color-paper-mute:rgba(242,240,235,0.56);
--color-paper-soft:rgba(242,240,235,0.42);
--color-paper-dim:rgba(242,240,235,0.30);
--color-paper-faint:rgba(242,240,235,0.10);
--color-warn:#FF6B5C; /* form errors only */
```

Treat `globals.css` as the executable token source if opacity values evolve
through approved contrast/taste rounds.

### Type roles

```css
--font-grotesk:'Bricolage Grotesque'; /* display headlines */
--font-sans:'Geist';                  /* text and UI */
--font-display:'Instrument Serif';    /* poetic italic only */
--font-mono:'JetBrains Mono';         /* labels, numbers, CTAs */
```

Fonts are self-hosted at build time through `next/font/google`. No runtime
third-party font requests.

### Motion language

- calm: `cubic-bezier(0.65,0,0.35,1)`
- arrive: `cubic-bezier(0.22,1,0.36,1)`
- depart: `cubic-bezier(0.64,0,0.78,0)`
- standard durations: micro 200 ms, short 400 ms, medium 700 ms, long
  1200 ms, morph 1400 ms, autocycle 9000 ms, breath 8000 ms.

GSAP/ScrollTrigger owns scroll choreography. Motion owns DOM micro-interactions.
Lenis owns smooth scrolling. Do not make two systems fight over the same value.

### Stack

- Next.js 16 App Router, React 19, TypeScript, Turbopack
- Tailwind CSS v4 + CSS variables
- Raw WebGL2 + OGL
- GSAP + ScrollTrigger, Motion, Lenis
- next-intl
- Sanity
- react-hook-form + zod + Resend
- Vercel hosting/OG, Vercel Analytics, Plausible

Ask before adding any dependency or substituting any layer.

## 7. Architecture Boundaries

- `app/[locale]/page.tsx` composes semantic RSC chapters and places Footer
  inside `PageStage`.
- `components/field/PageStage.tsx` owns DOM measurement, global input, live
  labels, the one canvas shell, and scene assembly. It does not own chapter copy.
- `lib/webgl/conductor.mjs` owns all between-scene state and invariants.
- `lib/webgl/scenes/*.ts` translates measured geometry into scene targets,
  form claims, extras, activity, and light score.
- `lib/webgl/fluid-core.mjs` owns velocity and environmental forces.
- `components/field/FieldStage.tsx` owns WebGL resources and drawing.
- `lib/webgl/sdf-glass-shader.mjs` owns the unified field and locked glass.
- `lib/webgl/post-chain.ts` + `post-shaders.mjs` (R5-C) own the framebuffer
  pipeline beside the renderer; every grade control defaults to identity.
- `components/field/CinematicVeils.tsx` (R5-D) owns the page-light layer:
  score-driven CSS-var veils at z-20 — above chapter copy, below all chrome.
  The post chain grades the liquid; the veils grade the page. Keep the split.
- `lib/webgl/field-drivers.ts` remains the shared §3.3 melt kernel, deterministic
  harness contract, and special-page driver home—not a second homepage brain.
- **There is deliberately no `app/[locale]/loading.tsx`.** Its Suspense boundary
  flushed the document shell — and a 200 status — before `notFound()` could run,
  so every unmatched path answered as a soft 404. Route transitions are covered
  by the cyan wipe in `template.tsx`, which now plays only on client navigation
  (a document's first paint has nothing to transition from). The localized 404's
  head comes from the sibling layouts at `[locale]/[...rest]` and
  `[locale]/work/[slug]`: a `not-found` boundary cannot export
  `generateMetadata`, but a layout that never throws can.
- The chapter rail rests at its numbers-only width and reserves `--rail-safe`;
  only the two homepage blocks that reach the page's right edge (the Studio role
  grid and the Work strip) claim it. `PageStage` measures the rail rather than
  hardcoding its column.

## 8. Working Conventions

- Inspect the worktree before editing. Preserve user changes and unrelated work.
- Work one R5 phase or one bounded chapter concern at a time.
- Use clear commits that identify the phase/spec, for example
  `feat(R5-C): add identity-safe bright pass`.
- Keep browser-only visual code out of RSC copy components.
- Keep `.mjs` simulation kernels DOM-free and deterministic so Node harnesses
  can run them.
- Avoid per-frame object/array allocation in scene target loops.
- Preserve measurement selectors used by diagnostics:
  `.method-journey`, `.origin-journey`, and `[data-organism]` unless the
  harness and documentation are intentionally migrated together.
- Build mobile, reduced-motion, no-WebGL, and context-loss behavior with the
  feature—not as cleanup.
- Do not keep dated audit Markdown at repo root. Fold durable decisions into
  README, this file, build spec, or the liquid spec.

Ask before:

- changing the stack or adding a dependency;
- changing the nine-chapter IA or five-act arc;
- weakening the one-canvas or same-droplet guarantee;
- re-baselining exact forms or the locked key-light direction;
- using a marketplace component on a signature surface;
- inventing or materially reframing portfolio/company facts;
- enabling audio.

## 9. Current Delivery Order

The old skeleton and R0–R4 build orders are complete or superseded, and
R5-A/B/C have landed. Continue in this order:

1. **R5-E Hardening**
   - iOS sticky/svh, Android lite-live, desktop full/full-nofx;
   - 30-minute battery soak and telemetry;
   - context-loss drill;
   - PT/EN, keyboard, screen-reader, reduced-motion, contrast regression;
   - real portfolio/contact content and production environment;
   - dead-code and documentation sweep.

Each phase is **build → verify → commit → owner review pause**. Do not silently
continue past a signature visual checkpoint.

## 10. Visual Review Protocol

These moments require capture review and owner taste feedback, normally 3–6
rounds:

- exact form material and §3.3 morph feel;
- pour/fracture readability and seek/converge weight;
- page-wide physics feel, including cursor and pinch-off;
- R5-C bloom, depth, banding, exposure, and grain;
- Origin fusion, single flash, afterglow, and pacing;
- Contact gather/exhale and Footer release.

For each:

1. Read the relevant build spec, liquid spec, and mapped references.
2. Build the smallest reviewable version.
3. Run deterministic captures and inspect them before presenting.
4. Stop for owner review on real hardware.
5. Tune existing constants before inventing a new renderer or effect family.

## 11. Verification Is Part of the Change

Baseline for every implementation phase:

```bash
npx tsc --noEmit
npm run lint
npm run build
```

Additional stop-the-line gates:

- Shader/SDF/post change: `npm run forms:rest` must remain exact.
- Morph/form change: `npm run forms:melts` and `npm run forms:cursor`.
- Scene/conductor/physics change:
  `node scripts/verify-conductor.mjs` and transition diagnostics.
- Homepage canvas change: `node scripts/verify-canvas-count.mjs` must report
  exactly one liquid canvas.
- CTA/navigation/form change: `node scripts/verify-cta.mjs`.
- Entry veil change: `node scripts/verify-entry-veil.mjs`.
- Performance/tier change: chapter sheets plus `verify-perf.mjs` on relevant
  hardware.
- Optics/grade change: `node scripts/verify-postfx.mjs` (statistical `?fgrade=0`
  equivalence, banding, seam, full-nofx drill, governor cadence) and
  `node scripts/verify-rest-exact.mjs` (settled-still byte gate — the machine
  teeth behind "rest must remain exact"; conscious re-baselines rerun its
  `--baseline` and commit `scripts/rest-exact.json`).
- Cinematic/scene/score change: `node scripts/verify-cinematics.mjs` —
  exactly one flash per page load (never re-fired, never under reduced
  motion or `?fcine=0`), exactly two act-fade bands on their seams (peak
  ≤ 0.41, released at every reading rest), living liquid over Work/Studio/
  the footer release, meniscus wiring, and the transient-contrast floor
  (≥ 3.5:1 under the fade peak; standing reads are veil-free).
- Tier/viewport/renderer-lifecycle change (R5-E hardening gates):
  `node scripts/verify-devices.mjs` (emulated matrix: iPhone-class live +
  static, Android-class lite-must-be-live, full-nofx rung, no horizontal
  overflow, stage == 100svh), `node scripts/verify-context-loss.mjs`
  (§12.5: the loop parks on loss, restore resumes mid-page state), and —
  for battery/cadence claims — `SOAK_MIN=30 node scripts/verify-soak.mjs`
  against a production build (governor holds idle, no idle demotion, flat
  heap, never frozen).
- Copy/semantics/locale/chrome change: `node scripts/verify-a11y.mjs`
  (landmarks, one h1, labels, skip link, keyboard menu, focus visibility,
  effective-background contrast, pt/en key parity, reduced-motion story).
- Ecosystem circuit change (`eco-circuit.mjs`, the S4 scene block, the vein
  layer, labels, or HUD): `node scripts/verify-ecosystem.mjs` — 13 veins
  drawn, 10 sockets + 10 labels clear of the chapter-index rail, hover AND
  keyboard raise the same graph-staggered pulse plus dock swell (`hov`
  channel), HUD follows, and reduced motion keeps the eco-stack story.
- Emulation is the regression floor, not the sign-off: iOS URL-bar collapse,
  real GPU probes, and thermal behavior still require the owner's hardware.

A harness exit code does not sign off taste. A screenshot does not replace
keyboard, locale, or machine verification.

## 12. Open Owner Decisions

Use the recommended default, leave `TODO(decision)` at the relevant boundary,
and flag it:

- Ecosystem center: unified mark/core plus small “Seu negócio / Your business”
  label is the current default.
- Portfolio: real projects and which outcomes are verifiable.
- Studio: anonymous role grid is the default; portraits require supplied assets.
- Origin: confirm the precise meaning of social/health/finance and whether the
  brothers remain anonymous.
- Contact/footer: real WhatsApp, domain email, site URL, and social handles.
- Audio: out for v1.

Do not let these choices block unrelated implementation. They do block launch
claims and the relevant final acceptance boxes.

## 13. Definition of Done

A first-time visitor can understand the offer immediately, feel fragmentation,
watch the same liquid reconnect into an ecosystem, understand seven services
and the five-phase method, see honest work, experience the true Origin story,
understand the studio, and contact Zirtuno through an obvious labeled action.

The experience remains coherent from Hero through Footer on desktop, live but
appropriately reduced on capable mobile, semantically complete without WebGL,
calm under reduced motion, accessible by keyboard, accurate in PT-BR and EN,
honest in every claim, and independently reversible at the physics and optics
layers without breaking exact form output.

*One liquid. One system. One motivated story.*
